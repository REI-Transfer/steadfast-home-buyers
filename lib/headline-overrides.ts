/**
 * Steadfast Home Buyers — Jackson, TN
 * Dynamic-headline override table for /v2 landing page.
 *
 * Each entry's `match` regex is tested against the sanitized `utm_content`
 * (= ad.name per locked URL params convention). First match wins, so put
 * MORE SPECIFIC patterns first (e.g., ConceptCode + Geo before ConceptCode-only).
 *
 * Naming contract: {ConceptCode}-{ConceptName}-{CopyVariant}-{Geo}
 * Full rules: ~/.claude/projects/-Users-williamyu/memory/feedback_ad-name-scent-contract.md
 *
 * 🚫 NEVER add B-prefix entries here. Concept B (Mailroom) is RETIRED.
 *
 * When a new ConceptCode ships in this client's Meta account:
 *   1. Add the override row here FIRST
 *   2. Deploy + verify on Vercel preview
 *   3. THEN activate the Meta ad
 *
 * To test a row manually:
 *   curl -sL "https://offer.steadfasthb.com/v2?utm_content=A1-CashRush-PASv1-JacksonTN" | grep "<h1"
